======================

image:logo.png[]

Its 2019.  Time for a modern fortune replacement.

This isn't your daddy's `bsdgames` utility.  `fim` is designed for the discrening terminal for power lesuire within their SSH session.

It proudly supports the following features*:

- BucketSort(TM) - by tracking impressions via a local SQLite DB, FIM guarantees your content will be displayed evenly without duplicates!
- Easily fork/share/collaborate epigrams via GitHub
- Cloud enabled with content from Twitter, Reddit, HackerNews, etc
- Interactive content! Asciienma! Automated GitHub clones!  And more!

_* in theory, none of this is implemented yet!_


== Getting Started

Alright, lets do it:

```
docker run mike4263/fim:latest
```

This mode is completely random.  To maximize your enjoyment, you will need
1) a local DB and 2) a `fimrc` file.  Use `setup_fim.sh` to set this up.
