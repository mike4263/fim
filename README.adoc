fim - fortune improved
======================

image:logo.png[400,400,align="center"]

Its 2019.  It's time for a modern https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)[fortune] replacement.  

In case you aren't familiar with the classic utility from `bsdgames`, fortune came from a time before the internet or even https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)[Gopher] when people had to dervive all their pleasure from terminal utilities.  It is a way of displaying epigrams - a pithy saying or remark expressing an idea in a clever and amusing way.  It was a time when engineers wore pocket protecters and wrote man pages with words like epigrams in them.

Nowadays, the terminal has made a resurgance among developers, adminstrators and other power users with heavy customization through tools such as https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh[oh-my-zsh] and beer emojis in our https://brew.sh/[package managers].  But somehow, we lost the simplicity of reading simple quotes in the terminal.  If your compile doesn't work, read a joke or two.  If you've just `rm -rf /` your database server, maybe some poetry will soften the mood.  If your boss are total jerks, read old school mailing list threads to see how neckbeards used to troll.

This isn't your daddy's `bsdgames` utility.  `fim` is designed to accomodate today's modern power user with the following features*:

- BucketSort(TM) - by tracking impressions via a local SQLite DB, FIM guarantees your content will be displayed evenly without repeats!
- Easily import/fork/share epigrams via GitHub

== Let me see it

`fim` currently supports about 13k epigrams from various sources that I've culled.  Content usally falls into a couple categories - insightful, old computer jokes, random jokes, old stuff.  Not to sugar coat it - these are 30+ year old references and many haven't aged well.

Here's a joke (with `cowsay` for extra emphasis)

```
[mike@ox]$ fim  | cowsay                                                                                                                                   [3]

```
But sometimes they actually make you think:

```

== FimGPT

Sometimes, the output is just bizarre


```

And, sometimes you will get creepy foreshadowing of our impending AI takeover with omnious takes such as:

```


... A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you
have turned into a pile of dust.

   > answer to a computer or artificial intelligence. It suggests that the

   > incorrect or mistaken in their input, as represented by the transformation

   > It is unclear if there are any specific references to individuals or

   > often hold immense power and are easily angered. However, it may also
   > simply be an example of computer-related humor common in the early days of
   > computing.
   > Overall, this epigram serves as a reminder to approach technology with
   > caution and respect, and to be careful with the input we provide.

== Getting Started

Enough chit chat, lets do it:

```
docker run mike4263/fim:latest
```

This mode is completely stateless.  To maximize your enjoyment, you will need
1) a local DB and 2) a `fimrc` file.  Use `setup_fim.sh` to set this up.
